 *  Opaque handle for a plugin widget shown on the display, given from host to plugins.
 *
 *  A widget is declared by the plugin in its TTL and is not tied to any parameter:
 *
 *    <plugin> ahw:widget [
 *        a ahw:Widget ;
 *        lv2:symbol "meter" ;
 *        lv2:name "Meter" ;
 *        ahw:columns 2 ;
 *    ] .
 *
 *  ahw:columns is how many contiguous columns of the display the widget takes, 1 when missing; on the Dwarf
 *  there are 3, one above each knob. The area handed to the plugin is that many columns wide.
 *
 *  ahw:fullscreen true makes the widget take the whole display instead, title and footer included, and
 *  ahw:columns is then ignored. The hardware controls keep working; only what is drawn changes.
 *
 *  ahw:pixelFormat lists the pixel formats the widget can draw in, ahw:Mono1 alone when missing:
 *
 *        ahw:pixelFormat ahw:Mono1 , ahw:RGB565 ;
 *
 *  A widget is only offered on a device whose display uses one of them, and is told which one in
 *  ALABS_HMI_WidgetNotification::widget_shown.
 *
 *  The user decides, for each area of the display, whether it shows the default content of the
 *  hardware control below it (e.g. the knob addressing) or one of the widgets of the pedalboard.
 *  The hardware control keeps working as usual either way, only what is drawn changes.
